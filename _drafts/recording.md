I got a few questions about my setup for recording the [course videos][] for [CS 6120][] this fall.
While I have no idea what I'm doing, here are some notes on the hardware and software I settled on.

### Camera

[All webcams are terrible][camo-blog], and the less-terrible ones are only available on the black market for 1 million dogecoin apiece.
I've been using [Reincubate Camo][camo], an app that lets you use an iOS device's actually-good camera as a webcam.
There are other apps that do this but they all seem to be crappy and broken except for Camo.
I used it first with an old iPad and now, less awkwardly, with my iPhone SE.
The result so so much better than my iMac's built-in webcam that trying it out for a side-by-side comparison made me make this face.

### Microphone

I have tried an embarrassing and expensive array of awful "speakerphone" products that somehow sound *worse* than my laptop's built-in mic.
Every one of them makes me sound like a 32&nbsp;kbps MP3 of a call from a payphone in hell.
Then I remembered that I have a [Blue Yeti][] that I bought from an old roommate back when podcasting was cool.
It sounds great.

### Metal Stand Dinguses

These are the ingredients:

### Software

The CS 6120 videos have me either explaining things by scribbling on an iPad or demonstrating things by typing in a text editor.
For the former, I use [Notability][]. Although I'm sure there are many other apps for this, possibly better ones---it's just the one I've been using forever (including when I taught the same class in person).

I use [ScreenFlow][] to record and also for to edit the video, including superimposing the recording of me over my iPad scribblings or my desktop. I have used ScreenFlow for a long time to record conference talks. It's not cheap but it's the best. They have [educational discounts][screenflow-edu].
