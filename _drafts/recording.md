I got a few questions about my setup for recording the [course videos][] for [CS 6120][] this fall.
While I have no idea what I'm doing, here are some notes on the hardware and software I settled on.

### Camera

[All webcams are terrible][camo-blog], and the less-terrible ones are only available on the black market for 1 million dogecoin apiece.
I've been using [Reincubate Camo][camo], an app that lets you use an iOS device's actually-good camera as a webcam.
There are other apps that do this but they all seem to be crappy and broken except for Camo.
I used it first with an old iPad and now, less awkwardly, with my iPhone SE.
The result so so much better than my iMac's built-in webcam that trying it out for a comparison made me make this face.

### Microphone

I have tried an embarrassing and expensive array of awful "speakerphone" products that somehow sound *worse* than my laptop's built-in mic.
Every one of them makes me sound like a 32&nbsp;kbps MP3 of a call from a payphone in hell.
Then I remembered that I have a [Blue Yeti][] that I bought from an old roommate back when podcasting was cool.
It sounds great.

### Metal Stand Dinguses

These are the ingredients:

* [ScreenFlow][] for editing the video, including superimposing the recording of me over my iPad scribblings or my desktop.
