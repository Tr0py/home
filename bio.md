Adrian Sampson is an assistant professor in the [computer science department][cs] at [Cornell][]. He works on programming languages, computer architecture, and the abstractions that separate them. He previously worked on [approximate computing][approx], the idea that we should allow machines to expose errors to some kinds of applications as a trade-off for computational efficiency. He sees approximate computing as an instance of a broader breakdown of airtight distinctions between hardware and software concerns.
