    - What are the common traits of domains that benefit from having a DSL? When is it appropriate to create which type of DSL?
    - Are there opportunities to combine efforts from (radically) different DSL projects?  Think common backend toolchains or common general-purpose embedding languages & metaprogramming tools.
    - Is there value in infrastructure to enable fast DSL development or development by non-specialists?
