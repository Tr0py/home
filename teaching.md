I am teaching:

* [Fall 2020: CS 6120, "Advanced Compilers."](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs6120/2020fa/)
  This is a new and experimental PhD-level course about programming language implementation.

I will teach:

* Spring 2021: CS 3410, "Computer System Organization and Programming."
  This is our department's introduction to architecture and the systems side of the world.
  I will co-teach with [Anne Bracy](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~bracy/).

I previously taught:

* [Spring 2020: CS 7491, "The Great ISAs."](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs7491/2020sp/)
  This is a new reading seminar on the history of hardwareâ€“software abstractions.
* [Fall 2019: CS 6120, "Advanced Compilers."](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs6120/2019fa/)
* [Spring 2019: CS 6110, "Advanced Programming Languages."](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs6110/2019sp/)
  This is our graduate programming languages course. It is "enjoyed" by PL-oriented and non-PL PhD students alike.
* [Fall 2018: CS 4110, "Programming Languages and Logics."](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/Courses/cs4110/2018fa/)
  This is Cornell's undergraduate programming languages elective. 4110 is full of content you'd expect to find in a graduate PL course.
* [Spring 2018: CS 6110, "Advanced Programming Languages."](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs6110/2018sp/)
* [Fall 2017: CS 2110, "Object-Oriented Programming and Data Structures."](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs2110/2017fa/)
  This the second course in our department's introductory CS sequence. I co-taught with [David Gries](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/gries/) and [Eleanor Birrell](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~eleanor/).
* [Spring 2017: CS 6110, "Advanced Programming Languages."](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs6110/2017sp/)
* [Fall 2016: CS 4110, "Programming Languages and Logics."](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/Courses/cs4110/2016fa/)
